# R_projects2022

Below are the projects that I have completed or currently working on in R from 2022:

**Baseball_Bat_Collision** is an ongoing project that I am working on with the help of Alan Nathan, which uses Statcast data to investigate the relationship between playersâ€™ swing and the resulting batted ball parameters, such as exit velocity and launch angle.

**BaseballData** and **Baseball_Stats** references Robert Frey's lessons from his YouTube channel. This include practice codes for analyzing batter's performance in various heatmaps such as launch speed, launch angle, spray angle, expected batting average, and home run probability.

**Capstone Project** is from Codecademy's lesson, Analyze Data with R. This explores the trends of popular anime of Japan over time and how that affects the stock prices of different companies.

**Peak_Exit_Velo** explores the relationship between launch angle and exit velocity of various hitters in the MLB. It computes the launch angle that gives the maximum exit velocity for each players and how that value affects their strikeout and homerun percentage. Furthermore, it investigates the relationship between attack angle of the bat, centerline angle (offset), and the resulting exit velocity.

**Pitching_Efficiency** is my final project for Baseball Analytics Course at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. It explores pitch metrics different pitchers in the MLB including velocity, movements, and command to determine what makes a good pitcher. In addition, it contains a Shiny app that enables a user to select season, team, pitcher, and pitch type from MLB, and display the corresponding pitcher's heatmaps of hits allowed per location and frequency of pitch per location. 

**R&D** include projects that I took part in Research and Development team for Illini Baseball Analytics. The main one that we are currently working on is Stuff+ project, and our goal is to quantify pitches using pitch models. We developed our own statistics including expected wOBA, expected RV, and whiff probability and used them to build different pitch models. Pitch models were developed using Machine Learning tools such as Random Forest and XGBoost, and pitch metrics (ie. velocity, movements, spin, etc.) were used as input variables.
