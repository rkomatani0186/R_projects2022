# R_projects2022

Below are the projects that I have completed or currently working on in R from 2022:

**BaseballData** and **Baseball_Stats** references Robert Frey's lessons from his YouTube channel. This include practice codes for analyzing batter's performance in various heatmaps such as launch speed, launch angle, spray angle, expected batting average, and home run probability. I also created an average map of batters which displays the batter's batting average corresponding to the 9 zones inside the strike zone and 4 zones few inches outside of the strike zone.

**Capstone Project** is from Codecademy's lesson, Analyze Data with R. This explores the trends of popular anime of Japan over time and how that affects the stock prices of different companies.

**Peak_Launch_Angle** explores the relationship between launch angle and exit velocity of various hitters in the MLB. It computes the launch angle that gives the maximum exit velocity for each players and how that value affects their strikeout and homerun percentage. Furthermore, it investigates the relationship between attack angle of the bat, centerline angle (offset), and the resulting exit velocity. The slides for presentation that I gave during Saberseminar in August 2023 is included.

**Pitching_Efficiency** is my final project for Baseball Analytics Course at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. It explores pitch flight metrics of different pitchers in the MLB including velocity, movements, and command to determine what makes a good pitcher. In addition, it contains a Shiny app that enables a user to select season, team, pitcher, and pitch type from the MLB, and display the corresponding pitcher's heatmaps of hits allowed per location and frequency of pitch per location. 

**R&D** include projects that I took part in Research and Development team for Illini Baseball Analytics. The main one is Stuff+ project, and our goal was to quantify pitches using pitch models. We developed our own statistics including expected wOBA, expected RV, and whiff probability and used them to build different pitch models. Pitch models were developed using Machine Learning tools such as Random Forest and XGBoost, and pitch flight metrics (ie. velocity, movements, spin, etc.) were used as input variables.
